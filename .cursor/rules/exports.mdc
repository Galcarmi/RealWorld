# Export Rules

## Explicit Exports Only
- NEVER use wildcard exports (`export *`)
- ALWAYS use explicit named exports (`export { SpecificThing }`)
- ALWAYS use explicit type exports (`export type { TypeName }`)

## Export Guidelines
- Before adding any export, check what is actually being imported/used in the codebase
- Only export what is genuinely needed by other modules
- Use grep/search to verify actual usage before adding exports
- Prefer minimal API surface - expose as little as possible

## Examples

### ❌ BAD - Wildcard exports
```typescript
export * from './module';
export * from './types';
```

### ✅ GOOD - Explicit exports
```typescript
export { AuthService } from './auth/AuthService';
export type { ResponseErrors } from './types';
```

## When Adding New Exports
1. First, check if the export is actually needed
2. Search the codebase for existing imports
3. Only add exports that are actively being used
4. Remove unused exports during refactoring
